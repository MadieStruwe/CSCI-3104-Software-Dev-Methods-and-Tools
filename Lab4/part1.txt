1. To change the background, I did the following:
<style>
    body 
    {
        background-color: blue
    }
</style>
If I was to write it in a css file, it would be:

2. Changing the margins moves where the boxes, and the numbers in them, are aligned to.
<style>
    div 
    {
        margin-left: 100px
    }
</style>
Chaning the padding changes the size of the boxes. There is more space around the numbers that are in the boxes. 
<style>
    #div1 
    {
        padding: 150px
    }
</style>
3. Here's the code:
<style>
    #div1 
    {
        background-color: yellow;
        margin: 50px;
        padding: 50px
    }
</style>
If the margin is over 100px the webpage "grows" to accomidate the larger space.
If the padding is over 100px nothing really changes
4. 
<style>
    #div1 
    {
        background-color: yellow;
        margin: 10px;
        padding: 150px;
        overflow: scroll;
    }
</style>
Scroll shows a scroll bar on the box
Hidden is the default look, without the scroll bar.
5. The boxes alight from left to the right. They are in order, i.e. 1, 2, 3. If there is overflow, they start a new row, going from left to right. 
If they have float right, they start from the right and go to the left. 
6. The first box, moves to the left hand side of the screen, followed by box 2, moving flush against the first. Finally, the thrid follows suit. 
7. They have the attributes border, height, and width.
8. There is no margin, and goes flush against the window screen. The default margin value, is not 0.
